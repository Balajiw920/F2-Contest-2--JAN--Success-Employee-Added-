1.Make a simple form with Validation through JavaScript.

The form should contain 3 inputs which are:
Name
Profession
Age
Note: All of these values must be filled inorder to submit the form.

An error message is shown in red if the required fields are empty.
A success message is shown in green if the fields are filled and the employee was added successfully.
As the user fills up all three details of an employee and then clicks on Add Employee button. A function is executed on click of this button which appends an object into an array.(15)
The structure of the array should be -
[{id:1,name:"jack",profession:"developer",age:20},{id:2,name:"john",profession:"admin",age:28}.... and so on]
Note: Make sure that the ID is given automatically to every employee.

Create a Table to display a list of all Employees.
Initially the table should be empty with only headings.
As the user keeps adding employees, this array is mapped to show the data in the table.
On clicking of the delete user button that specific object should be removed from the array and the row should disappear.
